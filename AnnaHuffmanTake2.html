        <h2>God</h2>
    		<p>I attend <a href= http://www.therockofsouthwest.com/> The Rock of Southwest Church</a> in Littleton, Colorado. Our motto is "A Real Church for Real People" because I am a mess and God loves me exactly the way I am, but He loves me too much to keep me this way. I give God full credit for everything I am and all that I have.</p>
