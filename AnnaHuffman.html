		<h1>God, Family, and Friends</h1>
		<p>My name is Anna Huffman. I love God, family, and friends.</p>
		<h2>God</h2>
		<p>I attend <a href= http://www.therockofsouthwest.com/> The Rock of Southwest Church</a> in Littleton, Colorado. Our motto is "A Real Church for Real People" because I am a mess and God loves me exactly the way I am, but He loves me too much to keep me this way. I give God full credit for everything I am and all that I have.</p>
		<h2>Family</h2>

		<p>Kyle was a part time student and a full time stay at home dad for the last few years. He just finished a program at Red Rocks Community College to become a medical biller and coder. He is searching for a job.</p>

			<p>Kevin is 6 years old and is in the first grade. He loves to laugh and make others laugh. This can be challenging for parenting, but thankfully he knows to curb his humor at school. He is often designated a role model at school and recently received an award for perceverance because he is always trying even with his learning challenges.</p>

		<h3>My mom</h3>
		<p>Secret: I am only able to attend Galvanize because of my mom's generosity.</p>
